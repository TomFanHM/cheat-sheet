title: Directional Warp
description: The Directional Warp is an interactive visual representation that uses WebGL and Three.js libraries to create a dynamic, immersive experience. It features a canvas displaying two images that are warped directionally based on time and the aspect ratio of the viewport. The project makes use of GLSL shaders for custom effects on the images, enabling a seamless transition between the two.
